        <h3>Standard Wash</h3>
        <p><strong>$75</strong> (Coupe, Sedan)<br><strong>$100</strong> (Van, SUV, Truck)</p>
        <p>This exterior wash starts with a pre treatment to help remove caked on dirt and road debris. The vehicle is then wiped down by hand to ensure no dirt is left behind. The final step is drying the car completely by hand to ensure no new water spots or stains form.</p>

        <h3>RAD Wash</h3>
        <p><strong>$100</strong> (Coupe, Sedan)<br><strong>$125</strong> (Van, SUV, Truck)</p>
        <p>This exterior wash is our step beyond. The vehicle will be pre-treated to remove any excess dirt or grime. Wheel wells and rims are scrubbed with our softest brushes to make them shine like new. After the wash is complete we wipe the vehicle down with a protective compound to enhance the shine of your paint! Windows are cleaned a second time after the vehicle has been dried to ensure no water spots form and helps water bead instead of sticking to your windows.</p>
